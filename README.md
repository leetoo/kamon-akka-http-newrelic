# kamon-akka-http-newrelic
Sample project showing Kamon.io with NewRelic integration monitoring an Akka HTTP application

You can generate the binaries using
```
sbt universal:packageZipTarball
```

And then you can run the sample application with
```
./target/universal/kamon-akka-http-newrelic-0.1/bin/kamon-akka-http-newrelic
```

I'll add more information on this as soon as I get the time to.
